Replication of "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development" (Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson - 2001)
This project aims to replicate the empirical analysis presented in the influential paper "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development" by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson (2001), published in the American Economic Review. The paper investigates the long-term impact of colonial institutions on current economic development.

Objective
Reproduce the empirical results using the same methodology and data.
Understand the role of European settler mortality rates as an instrumental variable for institutional quality.
Analyze the relationship between early colonial institutions and current economic performance.
Core Hypothesis
The paper argues that colonial strategies were shaped by settler mortality rates, leading to different institutional frameworks:

High mortality rates → Extractive institutions → Poor economic performance today.
Low mortality rates → Inclusive institutions → Strong economic performance today.


Methodology
Instrumental Variables (IV) Estimation: Uses historical settler mortality rates as an instrument for current institutional quality.


Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS):
Stage 1: Regress current institutions on settler mortality rates.
Stage 2: Regress current GDP per capita on the predicted institutional quality from Stage 1.
Data: Mortality rates of European settlers, institutional measures (like protection against expropriation), and GDP per capita across former colonies.


Expected Outcomes
Confirm the strong negative relationship between settler mortality and current institutional quality.
Demonstrate that institutions have a significant and causal impact on long-run economic development.
